# **Password Generator**

## **Project Description**
  A reworked password generator project I started mid 2022.
  
  As is right now the GUI is made up of customTKinter, it gives a cleaner vibe than basic tkinter. The functions remain somewhat the same as in the previous edition,       except for that it now takes 4 words, 4 symbols and 4 numbers instead of user input. Might change this to drop down selection element in the GUI in the future.


## **How to Use the Project**
  The project as is can be run in the IDE where it will generate passwords through the GUI.

## **Future development**
  I would like to add some way to integrate a function to where it either adds it to a dictionary of accounts, then exports it to a text file that again can be used
  in a password authenticator app.
