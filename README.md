# **Password Generator**

## **Project Description**
  A private Python project I started during some downtime.
  
 The goal with this small project was to create a password generator that selected a random selection of words, symbols and numbers (based on amount selected by user)
 append these to a new list, shuffle it and then concatenate it.
 
 The function I made uses 3 for loops to get how many words, symbols and numbers the user wants the password to contain and then as stated above, creates a password.


## **How to Use the Project**
  The project consists of two python files, one that runs in your IDEs terminal the other file runs through TKinter.

## **Future development**
  I would like to add some way to integrate a function to where it either adds it to a dictionary of accounts, then exports it to a text file that again can be used
  in a password authenticator app.
