# **Password Generator**

## **Project Description**
  A reworked password generator project I started mid 2022.
  
  As is right now the GUI is made up of customTKinter, it gives a cleaner vibe than basic tkinter. The functions remain somewhat the same as in the previous edition,       except for that it now takes 4 words, 4 symbols and 4 numbers instead of user input. Might change this to drop down selection element in the GUI in the future.


## **How to Use the Project**
  The project as is can be run in the IDE where it will generate passwords through the GUI.

## **Future development**
  Under are elements I would like to improve or add:
  - Word, number and symbol amount selector in the GUI.
  - A save passwords function that takes it and saves it to a library of passwords and named accounts like {"Twitter": "PASSWORD", "Facebook": "PASSWORD"}, maybe in a       for loop so it's printed downwards.
  - Styling elements, rework colors, maybe add shading.
