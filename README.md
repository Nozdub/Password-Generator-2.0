# **Password Generator**

## **Project Description**
  A reworked password generator project I started mid 2022.
  
  Utilizes CustomTkInter for GUI, takes 1-9 words, numbers and symbols to create a random password from a dictionary (book). 
  - Generates randomized passwords.
  - Stores passwords in dictionary format where user fills in user accounts/platforms in console (will change) as keys.
  - Writes dictionary to file.


## **How to Use the Project**
  The project as is can be run in the IDE where it will generate passwords through the GUI.

## **Future development**
  Under are elements I would like to improve or add:
  - Encrypt the file.
  - Having a way of checking what accounts are stored in the file and if the account name is recognized it replaces it instead of making a new entry?
  - Consider changing up the colorscheme.
  - Consider writing to Json file?
